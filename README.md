# **Better Item Frames**

**Invisible & fixed item frames in Survival!**

Easily turn your (glow or regular) item frames invisible or visible in Survival!  
You can also lock your item frames rotation to avoid miss-click issues.

# ðŸª„ How to use?
## Make Invisible item frames

In order to make your (glow or regular) item frames invisible, you need to right-click an item frame while sneaking and having Shears in the main hand.  
The background will then be cut from the item frame, making it invisible. This action will consume the Shears durability, the process will take into account the Unbreaking enchantment (even levels greater than 3).

## Make them visible back

There are two ways to make their background reappear: you can either completely remove the item frame and place it back, or if you already set up several of them and you want to save time, you can also right-click these item frames while sneaking and having a Brush in the main hand.  
The background will then be glued back to the item frame, making it visible. This action will consume the Brush durability, the process will take into account the Unbreaking enchantment (even levels greater than 3).

## Lock item rotation

In order to lock item frame rotation, you can right-click an item frame while sneaking and having Glass Panes in the main hand.  
It will consume a Glass Pane, as if it was fixed on the item frame. The item itself can be changed, but it won't be able to be rotated anymore. In order to unlock the rotation, you will need to break the item frame, and place it back.

# ðŸ§¹ Uninstall

Better Item Frames comes with an uninstallation process. Running it will:
- Remove all scores and storage specific to the Better Item Frames data pack
- If there is no more KawaMood data packs installed, also remove all common scores and storages

It won't turn visible or unfix the rotation of already modified item frames, though you would just need to break and place them back manually before or after the uninstallation.

The command to start the uninstalling process is the following one: 
```
/function pk_better_item_frames:cmd/uninstall
```
